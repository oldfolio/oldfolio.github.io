#### OpenNIC Project
Go to https://www.opennic.org to see which of their DNS resolvers are closest to you. OpenNIC servers periodically go down and occasionally just disappear. The servers that tend to work best for me (in North America) are:
```
192.52.166.110
158.69.239.167
```

#### DMARC Records
```
_dmarc.domain.tld. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@domain.tld"
```
DMARC action to take if either SPF or DKIM fail:
```
p=none; - take no action
p=quarantine; - mark message as spam
p=reject; - reject message outright
```
To send DMARC reports to an address outside the email sending domain, create a TXT record in the DNS of the receiving domain:
```
<email-sending-domain.tld>._report._dmarc.<receiving-domain.tld>.  IN TXT "v=DMARC1"
```
Of course, you will still need to create the basic DMARC record in the DNS of the email sending domain:
```
_dmarc.<email-sending-domain.tld>. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@report-receiving-domain.tld"
```
